# pixi panda!

a small wrapper over [Pixi.JS](https://pixijs.com/), including:
- a basic scene manager
- async / await shared resource loader
- keyboard functionality
- improved shapes and basic collision
- vectors and Complex numbers
- bad spelling :P

## start
with `npm` and `git` installed:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/esby-space/panda.git
cd panda
npm install
npm run dev
```
make to your heart's content!
- `src/main.ts` initializes Panda and Pixi, loads the assets, and runs the scene
- `src/game.ts` defines the main scene
- `index.html` contains the styling for the webpage
